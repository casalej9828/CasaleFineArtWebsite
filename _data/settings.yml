blurb: <p><strong>Jordan loves to learn.</strong> Jordan was raised in Littleton, Colorado in the shadow of the foothills.  He and his family moved to Goodland 4 years ago to embrace a more community focused life.  Jordan has been painting for 5 years, but his history with art stretches back much farther.  He hopes to express the beauty of Godâ€™s creation in a singular moment that normally remains elusive and passes too quickly.
